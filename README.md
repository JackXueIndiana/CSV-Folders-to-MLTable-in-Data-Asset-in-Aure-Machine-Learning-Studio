# CSV-Folders-to-MLTable-in-Data-Asset-in-Aure-Machine-Learning-Studio
This is an example how to write a YML file and structure the folders for CSV files that can be read as a MLTable in AMLS.

The YML file defines the path for all csv files in its sub folders. So, we upload the MLTable file to folder level1 in a Blob container. user1.csv and user2.csv in subfolders level2-1 and level2-2, respectively.

The data asset could be explored as int he png file if we do everything right.
